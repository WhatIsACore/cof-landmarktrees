Bald Cypresses can grow up to 100 feet tall in the wild and up to 70 feet in gardens. Its half inch-long leaves are feathery and delicate and yellow-tinged green in color. This tree tolerates wet conditions and develops knobby growth called knees when growing in water-logged soil. In the southeastern United States, Bald Cypresses are usually found in swamps and commonly have buttressed trunk bases.[34]",

It is one of the neighborhood's most prominent features because of its wide-spreading branches and unique branch formations. The tree was nominated for State Champion status, but lost to a slightly larger sycamore in Sacramento. On June 21, 2012, two days after Council placed this tree on the landmark list, a major branch failure occurred at the southwest portion of the tree. As a result, the tree lost its large, low-drooping branch structure as shown in the photos above.",
